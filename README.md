# Pothole_Reporting_Management
A Pothole reporting and management system using tkinter in Python to create GUI and Oracle for database management.

The Pothole Reporting and Management System is a user-friendly project designed to streamline the process of reporting and managing potholes in a given area. Developed using the tkinter framework in Python, this project provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) accessible to both civilians and government officials.

Upon launching the application, civilians can easily select their role as a civilian and proceed with two main options: "My Details" and "Report Pothole." Under "My Details," users can conveniently insert, delete, or view their personal information, ensuring accurate and up-to-date records. Alternatively, by selecting "Report Pothole," civilians can submit a detailed report regarding a pothole in their vicinity. The report includes essential information such as the date of the report, pothole identification number, number of accidents associated with the pothole, current status (active or inactive), the specific address of the pothole, and the date of repair if already addressed. Users can effortlessly manage their reports by inserting, deleting, updating, and viewing their submitted reports. Additionally, a comprehensive overview of all reports is available for convenient reference.

To ensure efficient and reliable data management, the Pothole Reporting and Management System utilizes Oracle for database management. The Oracle database provides a robust and scalable solution for storing and retrieving data related to pothole reports, user details, and government officer information. Leveraging the power and capabilities of Oracle, the system ensures data integrity, security, and efficient query processing.

Government officials, upon selecting their role, gain access to specific functionalities catered to their responsibilities. By entering their officer identification details, including their name and phone number, officials can efficiently manage their information by inserting, deleting, or updating their records. Furthermore, they can view their assigned responsibilities, specifically the pothole identification numbers they are accountable for. Additionally, officials have the ability to access an overview of responsibilities assigned to all officers, facilitating effective coordination and collaboration.

The Pothole Reporting and Management System offers an integrated solution to streamline the reporting and management of potholes, promoting efficient communication between civilians and government officials. By leveraging the intuitive GUI and utilizing Oracle for database management, this project simplifies the process of gathering, storing, and organizing data, leading to more effective pothole management and safer road conditions for all.
